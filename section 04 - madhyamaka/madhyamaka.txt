"There is also another argument which Nāgārjuna and Candrakīrti bring forward to establish that no dharma 'describes' and at the same time brings out the nature of any svalakṣaṇa thing. Independently of ascribing a particular dharma to a particular thing how do we know that it is a dharma of it? Unless we are independently sure that a given thing has the given dharma and that thing alone has it we are neither methodologically right nor logically justified in ascribing a dharma to a given thing. But by the very natrue of the case no dharma is given independently of a thing. It also is not there independently and naturally as a matter of fact. Like a thing no dharma is peculiar and particular that it can be given independently of anything else. This being the case dharmas are nothing in comparison with things of which they are said to be dharmas. Thus understood dharmas are ill-suited to bring out the nature of particular things. There is again no particular and peculiar justifiable reason why we should ascribe any dharma to any particular thing 'context-freely'; while contextual ascription of a dharma does more violence than justice to the nature of a thing. Every dharma is necessitated by our explanation of a thing or by the context, none of which is necessary to understand and discover things as they are given. Śūnyatā, therefore, amounts to accepting total incompetence of predicative language descriptively used to bring out the nature of uniquely particular or svalakṣaṇa things." (Marathe 1980: 535)
